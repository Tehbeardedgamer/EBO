## ROOF TOP UNIT (RTU-1) CONTROLS SEQUENCE

---

### 1. RTU Overview

Each RTU-1 unit includes:

1. **Eight (8) Variable Flow Draw-Through Supply Fans (SFs)** with VFD  
2. **Hot Water Reheat Coil**  
3. **Chilled Water Coil**  
4. **MERV 8 Intake Pre-Filters**, followed by **MERV 14 Intake Filters**  
5. **Face Damper (D-1)** and **Bypass Damper (D-2)**

### 2. General Rooftop Air Handling Unit

1. **DDC Controller**  
   - Operates under a dedicated DDC controller.  
   - The unit controller and VFD are housed within the unit.

2. **Application**  
   - The RTU provides space conditioning and dehumidification to the high-bay space.

3. **Loss of Communication**  
   - If communication is lost between the network control panel and the RTU system controller, the RTU defaults to **occupied mode** until communication is restored.

4. **Hot/Chilled Water Valves**  
   - The hot water and chilled water valves shall never be open at the same time **unless** explicitly specified in this sequence.

5. **Pressure-Independent Control Valves**  
   - All control valves include flow feedback to the BAS (Belimo Energy Valve or equal).

6. **Continuity of Operation After Power Interruption**  
   - Equipment and controls on normal and backup power return automatically to their previous operating states after power is restored.  
   - No manual operator intervention is required.

7. **RTU Equipment Override**  
   - The operator can locally override the equipment via a motor controller.  
   - The motor controller has a Hand-Off-Auto (HOA) switch (or similar) allowing remote automatic or local control.

8. **Equipment Runtime Calculation**  
   1. Runtime begins on a start command and confirmed “on” status; it ends on a stop command and confirmed “off” status.  
   2. Hours are totalized daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and since initial installation.  
   3. The DDC controller compares operating hours to maintenance intervals (entered by the operator) and warns when nearing those intervals.

### 3. Occupied Mode

The RTU can operate in **cooling**, **heating**, or **dehumidification** depending on conditions.

#### 3.1 Cooling Mode

- The RTU is enabled with the supply fan running at constant volume.  
- The 2-way, modulating chilled water control valve (CV-1) modulates to maintain a leaving chilled water coil temperature T-2 of 55 °F.  
- The face and bypass damper modulates to maintain the zone temperature setpoint (ZN-T) while ensuring adequate air throw to condition the space.  
- The hot water valve remains closed.

#### 3.2 Heating Mode

- The RTU is enabled, and the hot water valve modulates to maintain ZN-T setpoint with a maximum discharge air temperature (DAT) of 80 °F (adjustable).  
- The face and bypass damper is closed to bypass (i.e., no flow through the coil) and fully open to the chilled water coil; the chilled water valve remains closed.

#### 3.3 Dehumidification Mode

- If space humidity exceeds its setpoint, the modulating chilled water control valve modulates to maintain 53 °F leaving the chilled water coil.  
- The face and bypass damper is fully open to the chilled water coil.  
- The hot water valve modulates to maintain the zone temperature setpoint (ZN-T).  
- **Override condition**: If the hot water valve hits 100% open for 15 minutes (adjustable) and cannot maintain ZN-T, the face and bypass damper are released to modulate while the hot water valve remains 100% open, until ZN-T is satisfied.

### 4. Safeties

1. **Freeze Protection**  
   - If any temperature sensor reads 38 °F (adjustable) or lower, the fans shut off via hardwired safety, dampers D-1 and D-2 fully open, and an audio/visual alarm activates.  
   - The freeze-protection alarm requires **manual reset** after resolving the problem, at which point the system returns to normal operation.

2. **Loss of Power**  
   - On power loss, chilled water coil valves fail **closed**; hot water coil valves fail **open**.

3. **Smoke Shutdown**  
   - A smoke detector in the supply and return air ducts shuts off supply and exhaust fans via hardwired safety if smoke is detected, triggering an audio/visual alarm.  
   - After correction, the system resets and returns to normal.  
   - Coordinate with the fire alarm system.

4. **Cabinet Temperature (Off Mode)**  
   - The hot water valve (HV-1) modulates to maintain 55 °F at T-2 when the RTU is off.

### 5. Alarms

#### 5.1 Level 1 Alarm

- **Smoke Detector Alarms**

#### 5.2 Level 2 Alarms

1. **High Humidity Alarm**  
   - Space humidity ≥ 70% above setpoint for 30 minutes (adjustable).  
2. **High Temperature Alarm (Space)**  
   - Space temperature 10 °F above setpoint for 60 minutes.  
3. **Damper Status Mismatch**  
   - Dampers do not match command.  
4. **Supply Fan Status Mismatch**  
   - Supply fan status does not match command.

#### 5.3 Level 3 Alarms

1. **Controller Failure Alarm**  
2. **High Temperature Alarm (Supply)**  
   - Supply temperature 5 °F above setpoint for 30 minutes.  
3. **Low Temperature Alarm (Supply)**  
   - Supply temperature 5 °F below setpoint for 30 minutes.  
4. **Valve Status Mismatch**  
   - CV-1 or HV-1 does not match command.  
5. **Simultaneous Heating/Cooling**  
   - In cooling mode: If T-3 is 5 °F higher than T-2.  
   - In heating mode: If T-2 is 5 °F less than ZN-T.

#### 5.4 Level 4 Alarms

1. **RTU-1 Runtime Maintenance Alarm**  
   - Per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
