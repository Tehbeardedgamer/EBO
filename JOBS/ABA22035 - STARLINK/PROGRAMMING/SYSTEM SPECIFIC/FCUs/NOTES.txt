A WALL MOUNTED ROOM THERMOSTAT/TEMPERATURE SENSOR SHALL PROVIDE INPUT TO THE BAS FOR FAN COIL CONTROL.
EACH FAN COIL SHALL HAVE A FULLY PROGRAMMABLE UNITARY CONTROLLER CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THE REQUIRED SEQUENCE.
2. FAN COIL UNITS HAVE A 2-WAY CONTROL VALVE ON BOTH THE CHILLED WATER COIL AND HOT WATER COIL.

 PROVIDE A SEPARATE OUTPUT TO THE VALVE SO THAT THE VALVE WILL CLOSE OFF WATER FLOW 2 MINUTES (ADJ.) BEFORE THE FAN SHUTS OFF.

3. OCCUPIED MODE:

A. THE FAN SHALL CYCLE ON UPON A CALL FOR HEATING, COOLING, OR DEHUMIDIFICATION. WHEN SPACE TEMPERATURE OR
RELATIVE HUMIDITY IS SATISFIED THE FAN SHALL BE OFF.

B. WHEN ROOM TEMPERATURE IS BELOW EFFECTIVE HEATING SETPOINT +/-, THE HOT WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE
OPEN AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE. CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED.

C. WHEN ROOM TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE EFFECTIVE COOLING SETPOINT +/-, THE CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL
MODULATE AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE. HOT WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED.

D. WHEN ROOM HUMIDITY IS ABOVE EFFECTIVE SETPOINT +/-, THE CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL BE FULL OPEN, AND
THE HOT WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE OPEN AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. THE
FAN SHALL NOT ENERGIZE AND CONTROL VALVES SHALL NOT MODULATE UNTIL PLANT CHILLED AND HOT WATER SUPPLY
TEMPERATURES ARE AT SETPOINT.

4. UNOCCUPIED MODE:

A. WHEN BUILDING IS INDEXED TO UNOCCUPIED, THE FAN SHALL BE OFF, AND BOTH THE CHILLED AND HOT WATER CONTROL
VALVES SHALL BE FULL CLOSED.

B. IF SPACE TEMPERATURE FALLS BELOW UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT, THE FAN SHALL CYCLE ON AND THE HOT WATER
CONTROL VALUE SHALL MODULATE AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN UNOCCUPIED HEATING SETPOINT.

C. IF SPACE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT, THE FAN SHALL CYCLE ON AND THE CHILLED WATER
CONTROL SHALL MODULATE AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN UNOCCUPIED COOLING SETPOINT.

D. WHEN ROOM HUMIDITY IS ABOVE UNOCCUPIED SETPOINT, THE FAN SHALL BE CYCLED ON, THE CHILLED WATER CONTROL
VALVE SHALL BE FULL OPEN, AND THE HOT WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE OPEN AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN
UNOCCUPIED SPACE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. THE FAN SHALL NOT ENERGIZE AND CONTROL VALVES SHALL NOT MODULATE
UNTIL CHILLED AND HOT WATER SUPPLY TEMPERATURES ARE AT SETPOINT.

5. ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER (WHERE INDICATED ON FLOOR PLANS):

A. WHEN FAN/BLOWER COIL IS OPERATING IN HEATING MODE, IF HOT WATER VALVE IS 100% OPEN AND UNABLE TO MAINTAIN
SPACE SETPOINT TEMPERATURE FOR 30 MINUTES (ADJ.), ELECTRIC HEATER SHALL ENERGIZE AND MODULATE TO MAINTAIN
SPACE SETPOINT.

B. ALARMS:

a. THERMAL OVERHEAT PROTECTION

b. AIRFLOW PROVING SWITCH - DH SHALL NOT ENERGIZE IF AIRFLOW NOT PROVEN.

6. PROVIDE SETPOINT LIMIT ADJUSTMENT ON EACH FAN COIL GRAPHICS PAGE. SET LIMITS BETWEEN 70°F (ADJ.) AND 76°F (ADJ.).

7. PROVIDE A CONDENSATE OVERFLOW SWITCH, HARD-WIRED TO THE FAN COIL. IF THE CONDENSATE OVERFLOW SWITCH IS
ACTIVATED, THE UNIT SHALL BE DE-ENERGIZED AND ASSOCIATED CHILLED WATER VALVE FULLY CLOSED.
