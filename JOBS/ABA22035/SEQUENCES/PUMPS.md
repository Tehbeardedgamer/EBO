# CHILLED WATER PRIMARY PUMPING SYSTEM CONTROL SEQUENCE:

THE CHILLED WATER PUMPS P-1A/B/C/D SHALL OPERATE ON A LEAD/LAG/LAG/STANDBY BASIS. LEAD/LAG OPERATION SHALL ROTATE ON A WEEKLY (ADJ.) BASIS.

THE CHILLED WATER PUMP P-2 IS A TRIM PUMP AND SHALL BECOME THE LEAD OR LAG PUMP WHEN THE FOLLOWING OCCURS:

- IF ONLY ONE CHILLER IS OPERATING, P-2 SHALL BE THE LEAD PUMP.
- AS PUMPS ARE STAGED ON/OFF, P-2 SHALL BE THE LAG PUMP WITH HIGHEST PRIORITY.

THE LEAD/LAG/LAG/STANDBY PUMPS SHALL BE CAPABLE OF OPERATING IF REQUIRED BY THE DEMAND AND SHALL BE CONTROLLED BY DPS-1A AND DPS-1B SYSTEM PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL SENSORS TO MAINTAIN REQUIRED DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT.

FLOW STABILITY AND RATE OF CHANGE ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN SAFE CHILLER OPERATION. TUNE CONTROL LOOPS TO PROVIDE STABLE VARYING FLOW RATES THAT ARE FREE OF ERRATIC SWINGS CAPABLE OF INITIATING A CHILLER ALARM.

[x] PUMPS SHALL MONITOR STATUS FROM THE VFD CONTROLLER. IF STATUS IS NOT PROVEN, THE PUMP SHALL BE DEACTIVATED AND AN AUDIO VISUAL ALARM SHALL SOUND AT THE BAS. IN THE EVENT CHILLED WATER FLOW FAILS AFTER THE CHILLER IS OPERATING, THE BACK-UP CHILLED WATER PUMP SHALL ACTIVATE. ONCE THE CAUSE OF THE ALARM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AND REPAIRED, THE LEAD PUMP SHALL BE PLACED BACK INTO NORMAL OPERATIONS AND THE BACK-UP PUMP SHALL DEACTIVATE. PROVIDE A THIRTY SECOND TIME DELAY TO PREVENT FALSE ALARMS.

[x] THE TCC SHALL OPTIMIZE THE REQUIRED DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT INITIALLY SET AT 8 PSI (ADJ.) TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED WATERFLOW WITH CONNECTED EQUIPMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TAB CONTRACTOR AND THE COMMISSIONING AGENT. NOTE THE FINAL SETPOINT IN THE TCC RECORD DOCUMENTS.

[X] PRIORITIZE CONTROL LOOP SPEED IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER: BYPASS VALVE RESPONSIVENESS FIRST, PUMP SPEED RESPONSIVENESS SECOND, AND AHU VALVE CONTROL LOOPS SHOULD OPERATE THE SLOWEST.

# PUMP SPEED CONTROL:
- A DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR DPS-1 SHALL MEASURE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE IN THE LOOP. THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR SHALL BE WIRED DIRECTLY TO THE CHILLED WATER PUMP PRIMARY CONTROLLER AND SHALL NOT BE MAPPED THROUGH THE COMMUNICATIONS BUS BETWEEN CONTROLLERS.

[X] THE PUMP SPEED WILL RAMP UP AND DOWN TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE AT EITHER DPS-1A AND DPS-1B. MINIMUM PUMP SPEED SHALL BE SET AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CHILLER FLOW AT F-1.

[x] CHILLER CH-1 RECEIVES ITS REQUIRED MINIMUM FLOW THROUGH A BYPASS VALVE V-3. WHEN ONLY ONE PUMP IS OPERATING AT MINIMUM SPEED, THE BYPASS VALVE V-3 SHALL MODULATE OPEN TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE AT EITHER DPS-1A OR DPS-1B.

[x] THE CHILLED WATER PUMP LEAD CONTROLLER SHALL CONTINUOUSLY SURVEY THE LEAD DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR. IF THE PUMP CONTROLLER SENSES THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE IS BELOW THE PRESSURE SETPOINT, THE SPEED OF THE LEAD PUMP SHALL INCREASE.

[x] IF THE LEAD PUMP RISES ABOVE 90% FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN THE LAG PUMP SHALL BE ENABLED. THE LAG PUMP SHALL RAMP-UP AND THE LEAD PUMP SHALL RAMP DOWN TO THE SAME SPEED TO MEET THE PRESSURE SETPOINT. IF BOTH PUMPS ARE OPERATING AT 35% OR LESS FOR 10 MINUTES AND THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT IS SATISFIED, THEN THE LEAD PUMP SHALL INCREASE SPEED TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT, AND THE LAG PUMP SHALL SHUT-OFF.

[x] IF THE LEAD AND LAG PUMP BOTH RISE ABOVE 90% FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN THE SECOND LAG PUMP SHALL BE ENABLED. THE 2 ND LAG PUMP SHALL RAMP-UP AND THE LEAD-LAG PUMPS SHALL RAMP DOWN TO THE SAME SPEED TO MEET THE PRESSURE SETPOINT.

[x] IF ALL THREE PUMPS ARE OPERATING AT 35% OR LESS FOR 10 MINUTES AND THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT IS SATISFIED, THEN THE SECOND LAG PUMP SHALL SHUT-OFF AND THE LEAD-LAG PUMPS SHALL INCREASE SPEED TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT.

[X] IF THE LEAD PUMP IS OPERATING AT 35% OR LESS FOR 10 MINUTES, ONLY ONE CHILLER IS OPERATING, AND THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SETPOINT IS SATISFIED, THEN THE LOW FLOW PUMP (P-2) SHALL ENGAGE AND THE LEAD PUMP SHALL SHUT OFF.
