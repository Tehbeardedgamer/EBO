## PRODUCTION IDF COOLING UNIT SEQUENCE

---

### 1. Overview

- This sequence applies to a factory-controlled direct expansion (DX) unit that maintains space temperature in the IDF (Intermediate Distribution Frame) area.

---

### 2. General Operation

1. **Factory-Provided DX Unit Controls**  
   - The DX unit operates under factory-provided controls to maintain the space temperature setpoint.

2. **BACnet Integration**  
   - The AC/CU (air-cooled condenser and indoor unit) status and conditions are monitored via the unit’s communications interface port.  
   - Coordinate unit protocol for gateway BACnet MSTP communication.  
   - Provide a link from the zone graphics to the BACnet points (refer to M-700 for points list).

3. **Condensate Pump Monitoring**  
   - The AC unit includes a condensate pump.  
   - The BAS monitors the condensate pump status and command signals derived from the float or switch.

4. **Condensate Overflow Protection**  
   - The AC unit is equipped with a condensate overflow switch.  
   - If this switch activates, the unit deactivates, and an alarm is sent to the BAS.  
   - Coordinate the overflow switch placement with the overflow drainage of the drain pan.  
   - The overflow switch should not activate unless the overflow drain has clogged. The intent is to allow the drain pan overflow to handle condensate if the condensate pump fails.

### 3. Alarms

#### 3.1 Level 1 Alarm

- **Condensate Overflow Switch Active**  

#### 3.2 Level 2 Alarms

1. **High Temperature Alarm**  
   - Space temperature is 10 °F above setpoint for 30 minutes (adjustable).  
2. **Condensate Pump Status Mismatch**  
   - Condensate pump status does not match command.
