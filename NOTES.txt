# Let des know about any 


Based on the provided sequence for the Air Handler Unit (AHU 1A-1L and 2A-2D) here is a list of some things that come to mind. 

Mode Determination:
The sequence does describe how to operate in cooling, heating, and dehumidification modes when the AHU is in "Occupied Mode." However, there is no clear description of how the system determines which mode (cooling, heating, dehumidification) to be in. Typically, a sequence would include conditions such as "if the zone temperature is above setpoint and the humidity is below setpoint, enter cooling mode."
 */ TEST AND BALANCE 

Supply Fan Control:
The sequence mentions that the AHU should be enabled in both cooling and heating modes, but there's no specific directive on when and how to start the supply fans or how to control their speed. This is a significant oversight as the operation of supply fans is crucial for the AHU's functioning.

Supply Fan Variable Flow:
It’s mentioned that the AHU has "TWO (2) VARIABLE FLOW DRAW-THRU SUPPLY FANS," but there's no sequence that explains how to vary the flow or under what conditions to adjust the fan speed.
 
 */ TEST AND BALANCE 

Unoccupied Mode:
The sequence describes the "Occupied Mode," but there's no mention of what should happen in "Unoccupied Mode." Typically, an AHU would have different operations for when the space is not occupied to save energy.

*/ SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN

Reset Strategies:
Often, AHU sequences will include reset strategies for supply air temperature or static pressure based on conditions like zone demands. These are missing here.
*/

Filter Status:
While the AHU has MERV 8 and MERV 14 filters, there's no mention of how to monitor filter status or any alarms related to filter status.

*/ TEST AND BALANCE will give SP

Start-Up and Shutdown Sequences:
It would be beneficial to have a clear startup and shutdown sequence for the AHU to ensure equipment longevity and avoid unnecessary wear and tear.
*/

Fans off befoer dampers closed, and FAns on before HW valve open

*/ TEST AND BALANCE

Setpoints:
There is mention of setpoints (like 55°F for chilled water coil leaving temperature), but it's not clear if these are fixed or if they can be adjusted through the Building Automation System (BAS).

Differential Pressures:
It would be helpful to include sequences or alarms related to differential pressures across coils or filters to ensure they are operating efficiently and aren't clogged or restricted.

While the sequence provides a foundational framework for the AHU's operation, it lacks specifics in several key areas that are crucial for an efficient and effective operation.

I can program exactly what the sequences ask for but  AS the sequences for the ARU's 1A-1L and 2A-2D are a copy and paste  as they are written  it's simply only half way done. If I am to come up with my own sequences and controls for these points as they would be considered standard practice it will add significantly more time to their programming for the development and implementation which I assume have not been billed out or accounted for.

SAFETIES:
A. FREEZE PROTECTION: A FREEZESTAT SWITCH SHALL BE INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM OF THE HEATING COIL. IF A TEMPERATURE OF 38 °F (ADJ.) OR LESS IS DETECTED, THE
FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. DAMPERS, D-1 AND D-3 SHALL FULLY CLOSE, AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM SHALL ACTIVATE. THE FREEZESTAT SWITCH
MUST BE MANUALLY RESET UPON CORRECTION OF THE PROBLEM. UPON A MANUAL RESET, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

B. LOSS OF POWER: UPON A LOSS OF POWER, THE CONTROL VALVES SERVING CHILLED AND HOT WATER COILS SHALL FAIL OPEN.

C. OVER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL: A HIGH STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE SUPPLY AIR OUTLET, BEFORE ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE
DAMPERS. IF THE PRESSURE IN THE OA DUCT EXCEEDS 3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. UPON A MANUAL RESET OF
THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.
D. UNDER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL: A LOW STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE EXHAUST AIR INLET, AFTER ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE
DAMPERS. IF THE PRESSURE IN THE EA DUCT EXCEEDS -3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. UPON A MANUAL RESET OF
THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.
E. SMOKE SHUTDOWN: A SMOKE DETECTOR SHALL BE LOCATED IN THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR DUCTS. IF SMOKE IS DETECTED, THE SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS SHALL
SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM WILL ACTIVATE. UPON CORRECTION, THE SYSTEM SHALL BE RESET AND RETURN TO NORMAL
OPERATION. COORDINATE WITH FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.
F. FROST PROTECTION SEQUENCE FOR THE HEAT WHEEL: THE HEAT RECOVERY LOW LIMIT SETPOINT (HRLL-SP) SHALL BE PER THE MANUFACTURERS TEMPERATURE
SETPOINT. TO PREVENT FREEZING, IF T-6 (EA) DROPS BELOW THE HRLL-SP, THE BYPASS DAMPER D-3 SHALL OPEN TO BYPASS WHEEL.
G. EMERGENCY HVAC/VENTILATION POWER-OFF BUTTON (EPO): IF THE EMERGENCY POWER SHUTDOWN IS ACTIVATED THEN DOAS-1 SHALL BE DISABLED AND D-1 AND D-3
CONFIRMED TO BE CLOSED.
H. THE HOT WATER VALVE, HV-1, SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN A CABINET TEMPERATURE, AT T-3, OF 55°F WHEN THE DOAS IS OFF.
I. MAX VENTILATION OVERRIDE: UPON ACTIVATION OF A PUSHBUTTON SWITCH, THE DOAS SHALL INCREASE OA CFM TO MAXIMUM SETPOINT FOR 20 MINUTES (ADJ.). EACH
DOAS SHALL BE PROVIDED WITH A SWITCH. ACTIVATING ANY OF THE (3) SWITCHES ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER DOAS-2A, 2B, OR 2C SHALL ACTIVATE THIS SEQUENCE FOR
DOAS-2, 2B, AND 2C. ACTIVATING THE SWITCH ASSOCIATED WITH DOAS-2D SHALL ONLY ACTIVATE THIS SEQUENCE FOR DOAS-2D.




EMERGENCY HVAC/VENTILATION POWER-OFF BUTTON (EPO): IF THE EMERGENCY POWER SHUTDOWN IS ACTIVATED THEN DOAS-1 SHALL BE DISABLED AND D-1 AND D-3
CONFIRMED TO BE CLOSED.

THINGS FOR CHRIS.

ALL OVAV's

ALARMS:

IF THE DAMPER POSITION IS 0%, AND AIRFLOW SENSOR READING IS ABOVE 10% OF THE COOLING MAXIMUM AIRFLOW SET POINT FOR 10 MINUTES WHILE THE FAN
SERVING THE ZONE IS PROVEN ON.

AIRFLOW SENSOR CALIBRATION: IF THE FAN SERVING THE ZONE HAS BEEN OFF FOR
10 MINUTES, AND THE AIRFLOW SENSOR READING IS ABOVE 10% OF THE COOLING MAXIMUM AIRFLOW SET POINT.

    -I do not have any idea how to determine what fan if any is serving the space that this section of the sequence referrs to. There is nothing on the schedule that states this information.

CONFRENCE ROOM OVAV's


LEVEL 4 ALARMS:
IF THE DUCT STATIC IS AT MAXIMUM SETPOINT FOR 24 HOURS (ADJ.) AND THE SAME
OVAV IS ABOVE 95%.

    - THERE IS NO DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SENSOR TO MONITOR. 

TYPICAL ROOM OVAV's
    
    ZONE 2-03
    THERE ARE (2) CO2 SENSORS FOR THIS ZONE. THE OAV BOX SHALL SIGNAL SELECT BASED ON THE WORST CASE READING. THERE IS ALSO
    AN INDEPENDANT TEMPERATURE SENSOR (APART FROM THE VHP SERVING THIS SPACE) THAT SHALL OPEN/CLOSE A DAMPER FOR THE IT
    WORKSHOP.

    - There is no additional indepenant temperature sensor or damper that I can find anywhere and I have no idea what the IT WORKSHOP is. This does not seem to exist for our job maybe a copy and paste error from the engineers used from another job.


    DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET REQUESTS:
    THE DDC SYSTEM SHALL DETERMINE THE OVAV WITH GREATEST DAMPER OPEN POSITION ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES.
    THE DOAS OUTSIDE AIR STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL DECREASE BY 0.1" WC IF ALL OVAVS ARE OPEN 75% (ADJ.) OR LESS.
    THE DOAS OUTSIDE AIR STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL INCREASE BY 0.1" WC IF THE GREATEST OPEN DAMPER POSITION FOR AN
    OVAV IS 95% (ADJ.) OR GREATER.
    SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SETPOINT OF 0.5" WC AND 1.50 ” WC.

        -There are no DUCT STATIC PRESSURE SENSORS to monitor. Additionally nothing is being controlled to static pressure.








The sequence provided outlines the operation of a Dedicated Outside Air System (DOAS) in various modes and under different conditions. Analyzing the sequence for issues related to communication between the DOAS and the OVAV units, the following concerns and potential issues arise:

Lost Communication or Non existant Communication:

Under item 2.C, if communication is lost between the network control panel and the outside air system controller, the DOAS is placed into the occupied mode until communication is restored.
Issue: This could lead to unnecessary energy usage if the building or area is actually unoccupied.
Issue: If the OVAVs or VAVs have different requirements (e.g., reduced demand), the DOAS might over-ventilate or under-ventilate the spaces.

Occupancy Mode Based on Schedule:
Item 2.D states that the system will switch between occupied and unoccupied modes based on a user-adjustable schedule.
Issue: If the OVAVs or VAVs need ventilation outside of regular business hours and the DOAS cannot communicate this need due to a communication failure, the DOAS might not provide adequate ventilation.

OVAV Call for Cooling in Unoccupied Mode:
Item 9.E indicates that if there is an OVAV call for cooling during the unoccupied mode, the DOAS will be placed in occupied mode.
Issue: If the DOAS cannot communicate with the OVAVs, it might not be able to detect this call for cooling, potentially compromising indoor air quality or comfort.

While there is a manual override available on the OVAV units' controls, the sequence suggests that the DOAS operation, especially its transition between occupied and unoccupied modes, depends on communication with the OVAVs.
Issue: If there's a communication disruption between the DOAS and the OVAVs, even if a manual override is activated on the OVAVs (for example, to increase airflow in a particular space), the DOAS might not recognize or respond to this override command. 
As a result, the DOAS will not adjust its operation to meet the increased demand from the OVAVs, leading to potential discomfort, inadequate ventilation, or both in the overridden space.

Supply Fan Control with Reference to OVAV Sequences:
Item 6.C mentions that one should refer to the OVAV sequences for the duct static pressure reset requests.
Issue: If there's a communication failure between DOAS and OVAVs, the DOAS may not receive or be able to adjust based on duct static pressure reset requests from the OVAVs. This could lead to inadequate or excessive airflow in the spaces served by the OVAVs. 
Additionally this would reinforce the use of olderror adjustments from the PID loop causing the system to be less efficient and create an unstable control loop.

Graphics Indicating VAV Position:
Item 2.E mentions that the graphics will indicate the VAV with the greatest open position for troubleshooting.
Issue: If communication is lost or non existant between the DOAS and the VAVs, troubleshooting and pinpointing issues based on VAV positions would be challenging.
