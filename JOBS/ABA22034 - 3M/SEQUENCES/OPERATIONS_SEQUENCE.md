# UNIT INFORMATION: 

    THIS EXISTING AIR HANDLING UNIT IS A PRIMARY AIR VARIABLE AIR VOLUME TYPE SERVING SUPPLY AIR TO VAV TERMINAL UNITS TO BE FIELD VERIFIED.

# UNIT IS PRESENTLY EQUIPPED WITH:

    MIXED AIR SECTION

    TWO INTERNAL HOUSED CENTRIFUGAL SUPPLY FAN(S) INCORPORATING VFD RATED MOTORS

    FAN INLET VOLUME CONTROL PLUNGER / CONE DAMPER

    PREHEAT COIL, CHILLED WATER COIL, FILTERS

    AND OTHER OEM COMPONENTS. 

    NEW CONTROLS

# DDC CONTROLLER SHALL CONTROL THE UNIT AS FOLLOWS.


# UNIT START UP CONTROL / OPERATION UPON RECEIVING A START COMMAND, BASED ON NORMAL OCCUPANCY SCHEDULE, THE FOLLOWING OPERATION SHALL OCCUR:

    OMBINATION OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER(S)/FLOW STATION(S) SHALL BERELEASED OPEN TO THE PRIOR ESTABLISHED MINIMUM POSITION.
   
    THE NEW MODULATING UL 555S RETURN AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL REMAIN OPEN.

    SUPPLY FAN(S) SHALL START AND SLOWLY RAMP UP TO THE REQUIRED SPEED.

    THE SUPPLY FAN(S) RUN STATUS SHALL BE PROVEN.

    COOLING COIL(S) AND HOT WATER COIL(S) CONTROL SEQUENCE SHALL ACTIVATE AND VALVE POSITION SHALL INITIATE FROM A CLOSED POSITION.


# UNIT SUPPLY FAN(S) CONTROL / OPERATION:

    THE EXISTING FAN VOLUME CONTROL INLET CONE PLUNGER PLUG DAMPERS SHALL BE PLACED IN A FIXED OPEN POSITION. 

    SUPPLY FAN(S) SHALL RUN AT MINIMUM SPEED INITIALLY.

    VFD SHALL THEN BE COMMANDED TO RUN AT A SPEED WHICHPROVIDES A DUCT STATIC PRESSURE OF 1.25" W.C. AT THE 2/3 DOWN POSITION.

    THIS SETPOINT SHALL BE OPTIMIZED AND MODIFIED DURING TEST AND BALANCE. 

    AN OPTIMIZATION CONTROL ROUTINE SHALL REDUCE THE SETPOINT UNTIL ANY OF ALL OF THE TERMINAL UNITS DAMPERS REACHES THE 95%MAXIMUM VOLUME POSITION. 

    AS THE TERMINAL UNIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO 95% MAXIMUM VOLUME MOVES IN THE DIRECTION TOWARDS 100% MAXIMUM VOLUME , THE STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET TOWARDS THE INCREASING STATIC PRESSURE DIRECTION UNTIL THE TERMINAL UNIT DAMPER RETURNS TO ITS 95% MAXIMUM VOLUME POSITION. 

    SUPPLY FAN(S) SHALL RUN FOR A ONE HOUR PERIOD WHEN CALLED ON BY THE OVERRIDE BUTTON ON ANY SPACE TEMPERATURE SENSOR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UNIT.


# UNIT COOLING CONTROL / OPERATION: 

    COOLING CONTROL SHALL BE ENABLED ANY TIME UNIT IS CALLED TO RUN. 

    THE CHILLED WATER COIL VALVE SHALL BE MODULATED TO MAINTAIN CHILLED WATER COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE OF 55 DEGF.


# UNIT PREHEAT CONTROL / OPERATION: 

    PREHEAT CONTROL SHALL OCCUR WHEN THE MIXED AIR TEMPERATURE FALLS BELOW 55 DEGF AND THE OUTSIDE AIR VOLUME IS AT THE MINIMUM AIR VOLUME REQUIRED. 

    THE PREHEAT COIL CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN PREHEAT COIL LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE OF 55 DEG F.


# UNIT OA VOLUME CONTROL / OPERATION: DURING OCCUPIED MODE

    OPERATION, OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL BE RELEASED OPEN TO BEING CONTROLLED TO THE MINIMUM OUTSIDE AIR VOLUME SETPOINT, THE RETURN AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL BE OPEN, AND THE INDIVIDUAL OUTSIDE AIR FLOW SHALL BE MEASURED AND REPORTED TO THE BAS.

    THE TOTALIZED FLOW SHALL BE CALCULATED AND THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER(S) AND RETURN AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL BE MODULATED INDEPENDENTLY TO MAINTAIN FLOW SETPOINT.

    WHEN THE OUTSIDE AIR FLOW IS BELOW MINIMUM FLOW SETPOINT AND THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER IS FULLY OPEN, THEN THE RETURN AIR DAMPER SHALL BE MODULATED TOWARDS THE CLOSED POSITION TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM OUTSIDE AIR FLOW SETPOINT.

    THE RETURN AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL NOT CLOSE TO A POSITION GREATER THAN 50% CLOSED.


    WHEN THE OUTSIDE AIR FLOW IS ABOVE FLOW SETPOINT THE RETURN AIR DAMPER SHALL BE MODULATED TOWARDS THE FULLY OPEN POSITION TO MAINTAIN FLOW SETPOINT.

    IF OUTSIDE AIR FLOW IS ABOVE FLOW SETPOINT AND THE RETURN AIR DAMPER IS FULLY OPEN, THEN THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL BE MODULATED TOWARDS THE CLOSED POSITION UNTIL MINIMUM OUTSIDE AIR FLOW IS OBTAINED.


# UNIT DEMAND VENTILATION CONTROL / OPERATION:

    WHEN A SPACE CO2 SENSOR SENSES A CO2 CONCENTRATION OF 1100 PPM OR HIGHER, THE SYSTEM SHALL ENTER A DEMAND VENTILATION SEQUENCE.

    THE OA DAMPER(S) SHALL MODULATE OPEN IN A STEP AND WAIT ROUTINE UNTIL THE SPACE CO2 SENSOR READS A CONCENTRATION OF 900 PPM OR LOWER FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES OR THE VOLUME OF OUTSIDE AIR HAS REACHED THE SCHEDULED MAXIMUM REQUIRED VOLUME AMOUNT. 

    THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION AFTER CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES.

    DEMAND VENTILATION SHALL OVERRIDE ECONOMIZER MODE OPERATION.

    DURING THIS OPERATION, IF THE OA DAMPER HAS OPENED TO THE MAXIMUM POSITION THE RETURN AIR DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TOWARDS THE CLOSED POSITION TO ACHIEVE REACHING THE 900 PPM SET POINT.

    THE RETURN AIR DAMPER(S) SHALL NOT CLOSE TO A POSITION GREATER THAN 50% CLOSED.

REACHES THE POSITION THAT DELIVERS THE MINIMUM OUTSIDE AIR SPACE PRESSURIZATION.



# UNIT ECONOMIZER MODE CONTROL / OPERATION:

    THIS AHU SHALL BE PLACED IN THE ECONOMIZER MODE WHEN THE OUTSIDE AIR ENTHALPY FOR 30 MINUTES OR MORE.

    DURING THE ECONOMIZER MODE,THE POSITION TOWARDS THE FULL OPEN POSITION, AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MIXED AIR TEMPERATURE OF 55 DEGF.

    THE AHU SHALL BETAKEN OUT OF THE ECONOMIZER MODE WHEN THE OUTSIDE AIR ENTHALPY HAS RISEN TO THE SAME ENTHALPY LEVEL OR ABOVE THE EXIT ECONOMIZER SEQUENCE IF THE OUTSIDE AIR HAS EXCEEDED 90% RH.



# UNIT SPACE PRESSURIZATION CONTROL / OPERATION:

    THE SPACE STATIC PRESSURE TRANSMITTER MOUNTED IN THE UNIT DDCP SHALL MONITOR SPACE STATIC PRESSURE AND MODULATE THE RELIEF AIRDAMPER AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE SPACE PRESSURE OF +.05"W.C.


# UNIT NIGHT SETUP/SETBACK CONTROL / OPERATION: 

    DURING THENORMAL UNOCCUPIED PERIOD FROM 8:00 PM TO 5:00 AM, THE SPACE68 DEG HEATING.

    WHEN A TERMINAL UNIT SPACE SENSOR SURPASSES THE NIGHT SET BACK SETPOINT, THAT ZONE AND ALL OTHER ZONES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AIR HANDLING UNIT SHALL BE PLACED IN OPERATION UNTIL ALL ZONES ARE WITHIN SETBACK LIMITS.

    TEMPERATURE FALLS TO 38DEGF OR BELOW, THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL IF THEY ARE NOT ALREADY OPERATING. 

    THIS SEQUENCE SHALL CONTINUE UNTIL MIXED AIR TEMPERATURE HAS RISEN TO 42 DEGF OR HIGHER FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES. THIS OPERATION TAKES PRIORITY OVER OTHER SEQUENCES.


# UNIT FREEZE PROTECTION CONTROL / OPERATION:

    IF IF MIXED AIR TEMPERATURE FALLS TO 35DEGF OR BELOW, THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL SHUT DOWN, THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER SHALL CLOSE, THE CHILLED WATER COIL VALVE, AND HOT WATER COIL VALVE, SHALL BE COMMANDED TO OPEN. 
    
    A CALL SHALL BE ISSUED TO RUN HOT WATER ALARM SHALL BE SENT TO THE BAS HMI. 

    THIS SEQUENCE SHALL CONTINUE UNTIL THE FREEZESTAT IS MANUALLY RESET AND TAKES PRIORITY OVER ALL OTHER SEQUENCES.


# UNIT SAFETY CIRCUIT CONTROL / OPERATION: 

    FREEZESTATS, STATIC PRESSURE HIGH LIMITS, STATIC PRESSURE LOW LIMITS, FIRE ALARM SYSTEM SHUTDOWN RELAY DRY CONTACTS, SHALL BE TIED INTO THE UNIT SINGLE HARD WIRED SAFETY CIRCUIT TO SHUT DOWN THE UNIT UPON DETECTION OF ALARM CONDITIONS.

    SAFETIES SHALL BE MANUAL RESET.

AND THE SECOND SET OF DRY CONTACTS SHALL SEND A DEDICATED ALARM TO THE BAS. 

THE UNIT SHALL BE HELD OUT FROM OPERATION WHAT DEVICE CAUSED UNIT SHUTDOWN.

    EACH INDIVIDUAL ALARM SHALL BE SENT TO THE BAS AS A DISTINCT INPUT POINT FOR EACH SAFETY DEVICE FUNCTION, WHEN THE SAFETY CIRCUIT DE-ENERGIZES THE UNIT.


# UNIT CONTROL / OPERATION MISCELLANEOUS REQUIREMENTS :

    ANALOG.

    TRI-STATE ACTUATION SHALL NOT BE USED FOR THESE VALVES.
    UNIT CONTROL DAMPERS AND ACTUATION SIGNAL FOR MODULATING DAMPERS SHALL BE TRUE ANALOG.

    TRI-STATE ACTUATION SHALL NOT BE USED FOR THESE DAMPERS.
