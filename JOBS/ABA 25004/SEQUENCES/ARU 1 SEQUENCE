## AIR ROTATION UNITS (ARU-1) CONTROLS SEQUENCE

---

### 1. ARU Overview

Each ARU-1 unit includes:

1. **Three (3) Variable Flow Draw-Through Supply Fans**  
2. **Chilled Water Coil**  
3. **Hot Water Coil**  
4. **MERV 13 Filter**

### 2. General Air Rotation Unit

1. **DDC Controller**  
   - The system operates under a dedicated DDC controller.

2. **Loss of Communication**  
   - If communication is lost between the network control panel and the ARU controller, the ARU defaults to **occupied mode** until communication is restored.

3. **Hot/Chilled Water Valves**  
   - The hot water and chilled water valves shall never be open simultaneously unless explicitly stated in this sequence.

4. **Pressure-Independent Valves**  
   - All valves have flow feedback to the BAS (Belimo Energy Valve or equal).

5. **Continuity of Operation After Power Interruption**  
   - Equipment and controls connected to normal and backup power automatically resume their prior operating state after power is restored.  
   - No manual operator intervention is required.

6. **ARU Equipment Override**  
   - The operator can override equipment locally at the motor controller.  
   - The motor controller features a Hand-Off-Auto (HOA) switch (or similar), enabling remote automatic or local control.

7. **Equipment Runtime Calculation**  
   1. Runtime begins on start command with confirmed “on” status; it ends on stop command with confirmed “off” status.  
   2. Hours are aggregated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and since installation.  
   3. The DDC controller compares operating hours against maintenance intervals (set by the operator) and warns when intervals are approaching.

### 3. Occupied Mode

The ARU operates in **cooling**, **heating**, or **dehumidification** depending on requirements.

#### 3.1 Cooling Mode

- The ARU is enabled, and the 2-way, modulating chilled water control valve (CV-1) modulates to maintain 55 °F leaving the chilled water coil (T-3).  
- The supply fan runs at **constant volume** to maintain airflow/throw throughout the space.  
- The hot water valve remains closed.

#### 3.2 Heating Mode

- The ARU is enabled, and the hot water valve modulates to maintain zone temperature setpoint (ZN-T) with a maximum discharge air temperature (DAT) of 80 °F (adjustable).  
- The supply fan runs at constant volume.  
- The chilled water valve remains closed.

#### 3.3 Dehumidification Mode

- If space humidity exceeds its setpoint, the chilled water valve modulates to maintain 53 °F leaving the coil.  
- The hot water valve modulates to maintain the zone temperature setpoint (ZN-T).  
- The supply fan runs at constant volume.

### 4. Safeties

1. **Smoke Shutdown**  
   - Smoke detectors in supply and return ducts shut off supply (and exhaust, if applicable) fans via hardwired safety when smoke is detected.  
   - An audio/visual alarm is triggered.  
   - After correction, the system resets and returns to normal.  
   - Coordinate with the fire alarm system.

2. **Loss of Power**  
   - On power loss, chilled and hot water valves fail **closed**.

### 5. Alarms

#### 5.1 Level 1 Alarm

- **Smoke Detector Alarm**

#### 5.2 Level 2 Alarms

1. **High Humidity Alarm**  
   - Space humidity ≥ 70% above setpoint for 30 minutes (adjustable).  
2. **High Temperature Alarm (Space)**  
   - Space temperature 10 °F above setpoint for 60 minutes.  
3. **Condensate Overflow Alarm**  
   - Condensate overflow switch is activated. The unit continues to operate regardless of alarm status.  
4. **Damper/Fan Status Mismatch**  
   - Damper or supply fan status does not match command.

#### 5.3 Level 3 Alarms

1. **Controller (CGM-6) Failure Alarm**  
2. **Fan Status Mismatch**  
   - Fan status does not match command.  
3. **High Temperature Alarm (Space)**  
   - Space temperature 5 °F above setpoint for 30 minutes.  
4. **High Humidity Alarm**  
   - Space humidity ≥ 65% above setpoint for 15 minutes (adjustable).  
5. **Valve Status Mismatch**  
   - CV-1 or RC-1 does not match command.  
6. **Simultaneous Heating/Cooling**  
   - **Cooling Mode**: If T-4 is 5 °F more than T-3.  
   - **Heating Mode**: If T-2 is 5 °F less than ZN-T.

#### 5.4 Level 4 Alarms

1. **Air Rotation Unit Runtime Maintenance Alarm**  
   - Per the manufacturer’s recommendations.
