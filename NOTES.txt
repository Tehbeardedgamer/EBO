DEVICE CHECKS

IF DEVICE FAIL, DEVICE DOWN, PASS THEN DEVICE IS AVAIL FOR SEQ.

ONCE SEQ HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE FOLLOWING CHECKS ARE MADE
    - DEVICE FLOW SWITCH
    - DEVICE LOW PRESS
    - DEVICE HIGH PRESS
    - DEVICE ISO VALVE OPEN
    - DEVICE MAINTENANCE REQUIRED

IF ALL THESE PASS THEN THE DEVICE IS AVAILABLE TO START.

    SET LOAD - TODO

CHW PUMP
    SET STAGING - TODO




SET BINDS for CHILLERS BEFORE SEQUENCING.

CHILLER 1 = DEVICE_NA_1

CHILLER 1 = DEVICE_AVAIL_1
IF CH_DOWN_1 or CH_FAIL_1 or CH_PRESS_LO_1 or CH_PRESS_HI_1 or CH_MAINT_1 



LOW PRESS / HIGH PRESS = FAIL
MAINTENANCE = DOWN



IF LOW OR HIGH PRESS ALARMS TRIP then it auto fails.

EACH CHILLER HAS FLOW METER BUILT IN VA BACNET


CHECK DEVICE_N UPDATES WITHIN SAME STAGE / WRITE SETARTUP FOR EACH CHILLERS AND HAVE THAT CALLED WHEN DEVICE IS CALLED TO START FOR STAGING

CHECK INI, to re check values after each stage within  stager. 

DOAS 2 

No ERW SS and no way to control ERW SPEED as sequence requires

DOAS 1 and 2 EXA and SA Fans

COORDINATE TIMING WITH THE DAMPER ACTUATOR STROKE TIME.
EXHAUST FAN OPERATION SHALL BE PROVEN VIA CURRENT SENSOR ON EACH FAN. - Dont have any of these 

F. DOAS-2 EXHAUST FAN SHALL CFM TRACK THE SUPPLY FAN TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE PRESSURE IN THE FACTORY SPACE.
a. THE TRACKING OFFSET SHALL BE FIELD DETERMINED. ALL DOORS SHALL BE CLOSED THEN EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE ADJUSTED UNTIL THE
FACTORY IS NEUTRAL TO SLIGHTLY POSITIVE WITH PROPER OPERATION OF DOOR CLOSURES.
b. THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR QUANTITY OF EXHAUST FANS OPERATING IN THE FACTORY SPACE. AS FANS ARE ENERGIZED, THE
EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE INCREMENTALLY DECREASED DOWN TO MINIMUM FAN SPEED. REFER TO FUTURE BID PACKAGES FOR QTY AND SIZE
OF EXHAUST FANS.


NEED TO RESET Time on the BUILDING PRESSURE ABOVE AND BELOW
