# [x] GENERAL:
 -[x] THE SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE UNDER THE CONTROL OF A DEDICATED DDC CONTROLLER. UNIT CONTROLLER AND VFD TO BE HOUSED WITHIN THE UNIT.
 -[x] THE DOAS PROVIDES VENTILATION THE MAIN FACTORY FLOOR SPACE.
 -[x] IF COMMUNICATION IS LOST BETWEEN THE NETWORK CONTROL PANEL AND THE OUTSIDE AIR SYSTEM CONTROLLER, THEN THE OUTSIDE AIR SYSTEM SHALL
    BE PLACED INTO THE OCCUPIED MODE UNTIL COMMUNICATION IS RESTORED.
 -[x] THE SYSTEM SHALL BE PLACED INTO THE OCCUPIED/UNOCCUPIED MODE BASED UPON THE USER ADJUSTABLE SCHEDULE AT THE USER INTERFACE. THESE
    SYSTEMS SHALL BE SCHEDULED “ON” IN THE OCCUPIED MODE, ONLY DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS.
 -[X] CONTROL VALVES SHALL BE PRESSURE INDEPENDENT WITH FLOW FEEDBACK TO THE BAS - BELIMO ENERGY VALVE OR EQUAL.
    
## -[X] MODE OF OPERATION: THE DOAS WILL BE PLACED INTO A MODE OF OPERATION BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING OUTSIDE AIR TEMPERATURE SCHEDULE:

-[X] COOLING MODE: THE ERW SHALL BE ON AND THE 2-WAY, MODULATING CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE CHWC_VALVE_CTRL SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN CHWC_SA_TEMP SETPOINT OF SETPOINT OF 55°F.

-[X] ECONOMIZER COOLING MODE: THE ERW SHALL BE OFF, THE CLG VALVE CV-1 SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN T-3 SETPOINT. IF THE ENTHALPY IS GREATER
    THAN 26 BTU/LB, AS CALCULATED WITH T-0 AND H-0, THEN THE WHEEL SHALL BE ENABLED.

-[X] ECONOMIZER MODE: THE ERW SHALL BE ON AND THE DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN T-3. IF ADDITIONAL COOLING IS REQUIRED, THE 2-WAY,
    MODULATING CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE CV-1 SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN T-3 SETPOINT. REFER TO TABLE FOR ADDITIONAL SEQUENCING.

-[X] HEATING MODE: THE ERW SHALL BE AT ON. IF ADDITIONAL HEATING IS REQUIRED MODULATE THE HEATING VALVE HV-1 TO MAINTAIN T-3 (OA) SETPOINT.

# [X] OCCUPIED MODE:

- -[X] WHEN PLACED INTO THE OCCUPIED MODE, THE FOLLOWING SHALL OCCUR IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER. THE UNIT SHALL NOT START IF ANY ONE COMPONENT
DOES NOT PROVE OPERATION.

- -[X] THE ERW SHALL BE ENABLED AY 100% SPEED.

- -[X] DOAS-2 EXHAUST FANS SHALL BE ENABLED AND THE INTERLOCKED D-2 SHALL OPEN. COORDINATE TIMING WITH THE DAMPER ACTUATOR STROKE TIME.
EXHAUST FAN OPERATION SHALL BE PROVEN VIA CURRENT SENSOR ON EACH FAN.

- -[X] DOAS-2 SUPPLY FANS SHALL BE ENABLED AND THE INTERLOCKED D-1 SHALL OPEN. COORDINATE TIMING WITH THE DAMPER ACTUATOR STROKE TIME.
OPERATION SHALL BE PROVEN VIA CURRENT SENSOR ON EACH FAN.

- -[X] DOAS-2 SUPPLY FANS SHALL MODULATE SPEED FROM MINIMUM TO MAXIMUM SETPOINT TO MAINTAIN A TVOC SETPOINT OF 400 PPB (ADJUSTABLE).

- -[X] DOAS-2 EXHAUST FAN SHALL CFM TRACK THE SUPPLY FAN TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE PRESSURE IN THE FACTORY SPACE.

    - HE TRACKING OFFSET SHALL BE FIELD DETERMINED. ALL DOORS SHALL BE CLOSED THEN EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE ADJUSTED UNTIL THE
    FACTORY IS NEUTRAL TO SLIGHTLY POSITIVE WITH PROPER OPERATION OF DOOR CLOSURES.

    - THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR QUANTITY OF EXHAUST FANS OPERATING IN THE FACTORY SPACE. AS FANS ARE ENERGIZED, THE
        EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE INCREMENTALLY DECREASED DOWN TO MINIMUM FAN SPEED. REFER TO FUTURE BID PACKAGES FOR QTY AND SIZE
        OF EXHAUST FANS.

    - THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL MEASURE BUILDING PRESSURE TO BE USED AS HI- AND LO- LIMITS FOR FAN OPERATION. 
        
        BUILDING PRESSURE SETPOINTS SHALL BE +0.02 IN W.C. DURING COOLING SEASON AND -0.00 IN W.C. DURING HEATING SEASON (BOTH SETPOINTS ADJUSTABLE).
        IF BUILDING PRESSURE INCREASES ABOVE SETPOINT DEADBAND FOR 30 MINUTES (ADJ.), EXHAUST FAN SHALL INCREASE SPEED TO 100% (ADJ.).
        WHEN BUILDING PRESSURE IS BELOW SETPOINT FOR 30 MINUTES (ADJ.), EXHAUST FAN SHALL RETURN TO OPERATE ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS
        SEQUENCES.

        IF EXHAUST FAN IS AT MINIMUM SPEED AND BUILDING PRESSURE IS BELOW SETPOINT DEADBAND FOR 30 MINUTES (ADJ.), EXHAUST FAN SHALL
        DEENERGIZE, UNIT ERW SHALL BE OFF AND IN BYPASS MODE, AND SUPPLY FAN SHALL OPERATE ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS SEQUENCES.

# [] FAN SPEED HI-LIMIT:

THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL SET A SPEED HI LIMIT AT EACH SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FAN VFD.

WHEN FAN STATUS DOES NOT EQUAL COMMAND FOR ONE OR MORE FANS, THE VFD SPEED HI LIMIT SHALL BE RELEASED TO ALLOW ALL INDIVIDUAL FANS TO OPERATE AT MAXIMUM AIRFLOW CAPACITY. 

A SUPPLY FAN FAILURE SHALL ONLY RELEASE THE HI LIMIT FOR SUPPLY FANS. AN EXHAUST FAN FAILURE SHALL ONLY RELEASE THE HI LIMIT FOR EXHAUST FANS.

THE HI LIMIT SETPOINT CORRESPONDS TO UNIT DESIGN AIRFLOW WITH ALL FANS OPERATING. COORDINATE HI LIMIT SETPOINT WITH THE TEST AND BALANCE CONTRACTOR.

# [X] UNOCCUPIED MODE:
- -[X] THE UNIT SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS SHALL BE OFF. OA/EA DAMPERS D-1 AND D-2 SHALL BE CLOSED.
- -[X] CHILLED WATER VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED.
- -[X] HOT WATER VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED.
- -[X] ERW SHALL BE OFF.

# [] SAFETIES:

- -[]FREEZE PROTECTION: 
A FREEZESTAT SWITCH SHALL BE INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM OF THE HEATING COIL. 

IF A TEMPERATURE OF 38 °F (ADJ.) OR LESS IS DETECTED, THE
FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY.

DAMPERS, D-1 AND D-3 SHALL FULLY CLOSE, AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM SHALL ACTIVATE. THE FREEZESTAT SWITCH MUST BE MANUALLY RESET UPON CORRECTION OF THE PROBLEM. 

UPON A MANUAL RESET, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

- -[]LOSS OF POWER: 
UPON A LOSS OF POWER, THE CONTROL VALVES SERVING CHILLED AND HOT WATER COILS SHALL FAIL OPEN.

- -[]OVER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL:
A HIGH STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE SUPPLY AIR OUTLET, BEFORE ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE DAMPERS.

IF THE PRESSURE IN THE OA DUCT EXCEEDS 3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY.
UPON A MANUAL RESET OF THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

- -[]UNDER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL: 
A LOW STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE EXHAUST AIR INLET, AFTER ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE DAMPERS.

IF THE PRESSURE IN THE EA DUCT EXCEEDS -3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. UPON A MANUAL RESET OF THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

- -[]SMOKE SHUTDOWN: 

A SMOKE DETECTOR SHALL BE LOCATED IN THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR DUCTS. IF SMOKE IS DETECTED, THE SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM WILL ACTIVATE. 

UPON CORRECTION, THE SYSTEM SHALL BE RESET AND RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

COORDINATE WITH FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.

- -[]FROST PROTECTION SEQUENCE FOR THE HEAT WHEEL:

THE HEAT RECOVERY LOW LIMIT SETPOINT (HRLL-SP) SHALL BE PER THE MANUFACTURERS TEMPERATURE SETPOINT. 

TO PREVENT FREEZING, IF T-6 (EA) DROPS BELOW THE HRLL-SP, THE BYPASS DAMPER D-3 SHALL OPEN TO BYPASS WHEEL.

- -[]EMERGENCY HVAC/VENTILATION POWER-OFF BUTTON (EPO):

IF THE EMERGENCY POWER SHUTDOWN IS ACTIVATED THEN DOAS-1 SHALL BE DISABLED AND D-1 AND D-3 CONFIRMED TO BE CLOSED.

- -[]MAX VENTILATION OVERRIDE:

UPON ACTIVATION OF A PUSHBUTTON SWITCH, THE DOAS SHALL INCREASE OA CFM TO MAXIMUM SETPOINT FOR 20 MINUTES (ADJ.). 

EACH DOAS SHALL BE PROVIDED WITH A SWITCH.

ACTIVATING ANY OF THE (3) SWITCHES ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER DOAS-2A, 2B, OR 2C SHALL
ACTIVATE THIS SEQUENCE FOR DOAS-2, 2B, AND 2C.
