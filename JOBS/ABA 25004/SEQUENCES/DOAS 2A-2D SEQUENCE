## DEDICATED OUTSIDE AIR HANDLING UNITS (DOAS-2A THROUGH D)
*Outside Air Conditions*
**COOLING MODE** 
| T-0 > T-5 (EA) + 2°F AND h > 26 (ADJ) at T-0, H-0 |                            
 When the exhaust air is colder than the outside air or outside air enthalpy is greater than 26 BTU/lb (ADJ), the wheel is on and will provide pre-cooling of the outside air. The +2°F is a dead-band to transition between "economizer cooling" and cooling mode. OA/EA bypass dampers D-4 and D-5 shall be closed.

**ECONOMIZER COOLING MODE**
| T-0 > T-4 (OA) **and** T-0 < T-5 (EA) **and** h < 26 (ADJ) at T-0, H-0 |
When outside air is cooler than the exhaust air but warmer than the DAT setpoint and outside air enthalpy is less than 26 BTU/lb (ADJ), the ERW is off (since it cannot pre-cool the air). OA/EA bypass dampers D-4 and D-5 shall be open.

**ECONOMIZER MODE** 
| T-0 < T-4 (OA) - 2°F |
When the outside air is colder than the discharge air temperature setpoint by 2°F, then the wheel will be enabled. The 2°F serves as a dead-band to transition between "economizer cooling" and "economizer mode." The wheel is on to preheat, and the exhaust damper modulates to maintain a DAT setpoint of 55°F. This allows exhaust air to bypass the wheel and controls the amount of heat recovered. OA bypass damper D-4 shall be closed.

**HEATING MODE** 
| T-1 (OA) < T-4 (OA) setpoint - 2°F **and** the exhaust bypass damper is closed |
If the wheel is on and the exhaust bypass damper is closed, and air leaving the wheel is 2°F below the DAT setpoint, then the heating valve will modulate to provide additional heating.

---

### 2. General

1. **Dedicated DDC Controller**  
   - Each DOAS operates under a dedicated DDC controller. The unit controller and VFD are housed within the unit.

2. **Ventilation for Open Factory Space**  
   - These DOAS units provide ventilation air to the open factory space.

3. **Loss of Communication**  
   - If communication between the network control panel and the outside air system controller is lost, the outside air system defaults to **occupied mode** until communication is restored.

4. **Occupied/Unoccupied Scheduling**  
   - The system transitions between occupied and unoccupied modes based on a user-adjustable schedule at the user interface.  
   - DOAS units run only during regular business hours (occupied mode) and are **off** when the building is unoccupied, unless there is a call from the OVAV systems serving the spaces.  
   - Refer to OVAV sequences for additional details.

5. **Control Valves**  
   - All control valves are pressure independent with flow feedback to the BAS (Belimo Energy Valve or equal).

### 3. Supply Fan Control

1. **Supply Fan Enable and Proof**  
   - The supply fan array (SFS) starts, and operation is proven via a current sensor on each fan.

2. **Constant Volume Control**  
   - The supply fan array is controlled to maintain a **constant volume** of airflow, ensuring proper air throw at the system discharge plenum.

---

### 4. Exhaust Fan Control

1. **Tracking the Supply Fan**  
   - The exhaust fan modulates speed to maintain exhaust air CFM (AFMS-EA) at 90% (adjustable) of the outside air CFM (AFMS-OA), thus keeping the building at a **slight positive pressure**.  
   - Exhaust air damper D-3 interlocks to open whenever the exhaust fan array operates (coordinate timing with actuator stroke).

2. **Offset Adjustment**  
   - The BAS monitors building pressure and door closure conditions to set the final offset so that the mezzanine is neutral to slightly positive.  
   - All doors should be closed during this adjustment.

3. **Additional Exhaust Fans in Factory Space**  
   - The BAS monitors the number of other exhaust fans in the open factory space.  
   - As additional fans energize, the DOAS exhaust airflow offset is incrementally decreased toward a minimum fan speed.  
   - Refer to future bid packages for quantity and size of those exhaust fans. The programming for this sequence is included in the current bid package.

4. **Building Pressure Limits**  
   - The BAS measures building pressure to provide high/low limits for exhaust fan operation.  
   - Building pressure setpoints are:  
     - +0.02 in. w.c. for cooling season  
     - 0.00 in. w.c. (or slightly negative) for heating season  
   - Both are adjustable.

   **a. High Pressure Condition**  
   - If building pressure rises above the setpoint deadband for 30 minutes (adjustable), the exhaust fan speeds up to maintain 110% (adjustable) of the outside air CFM (AFMS-OA).  
   - Once building pressure is below setpoint for 30 minutes (adjustable), the fan returns to its normal sequence.

   **b. Low Pressure Condition**  
   - If the exhaust fan is at minimum speed and building pressure remains below setpoint deadband for 30 minutes (adjustable), the exhaust fan de-energizes, the ERW is turned off and put in bypass mode, and the supply fan continues per its previous sequence.

---

### 5. Fan Speed High-Limit

- The BAS sets a speed high limit at each supply and exhaust fan VFD.  
- If fan status does not match command for **one or more fans**, that fan group’s VFD speed high limit is released to allow **all** individual fans in that group to run at maximum capacity.  
  - A supply fan failure only releases the high limit for supply fans.  
  - An exhaust fan failure only releases the high limit for exhaust fans.  
- The high limit setpoint corresponds to unit design airflow with all fans operating.  
- Coordinate final high limit setpoints with the Test and Balance (TAB) contractor.

### 6. Occupied Mode

When switched to **occupied mode**, the system starts **in sequence**. The unit does **not** start if **any** component fails to prove operation:

1. **Exhaust Fans**  
   - Exhaust fans enable, and interlocked damper D-3 opens (coordinate timing with actuator stroke time).

2. **Supply Fans**  
   - Supply fans enable, and recirculation damper D-2 initially opens (coordinate timing with actuator stroke time).

3. **Exhaust Fan Tracking**  
   - The exhaust fan tracks the supply fan airflow at the field-determined offset.

4. **Pre-Cooling**  
   - If in cooling mode, chilled water valve CV-1 opens 100% **prior** to starting the supply fan to maintain the discharge air temperature setpoint T-3.

#### 6.1 Occupied Modes of Operation

The DOAS unit operates in one of several sub-modes based on outside air temperature or zone conditions:

---

#### A. Cooling Mode

1. **ERW**  
   - Enabled.

2. **Bypass Dampers**  
   - D-4 and D-5 are closed.

3. **Outside Air Damper (D-1)**  
   - Modulates to maintain a zone TVOC setpoint of 400 ppb (adjustable).

4. **Recirculation Damper (D-2)**  
   - Modulates inversely proportional to D-1:  
     - When D-1 is fully open, D-2 is fully closed.  
     - When D-1 is at minimum, D-2 is fully open.  
     - Damper position varies linearly between these extremes (coordinate with TAB and commissioning agent).

5. **Chilled Water Valve (CV-1)**  
   - 2-way modulating valve that maintains a discharge air temperature (T-3) setpoint of 55°F (adjustable).

---

#### B. Economizer Cooling

1. **ERW**  
   - Off.

2. **Bypass Dampers**  
   - D-4 and D-5 are open.

3. **Outside Air Damper (D-1) & Recirc Damper (D-2)**  
   - Modulate proportionally to maintain the worst-case of zone TVOC or zone temperature setpoint.

4. **Chilled Water Valve (CV-1)**  
   - Normally off in this mode.  
   - However, if D-1 is fully open and zone temperature is still above setpoint, CV-1 modulates to maintain zone temperature.  
   - If zone humidity (ZN-H) > 60%, CV-1 modulates to maintain 55°F (adj.) discharge air temperature.

---

#### C. Economizer (With ERW Enabled)

1. **ERW**  
   - Enabled.

2. **Bypass Dampers**  
   - D-4 (outside air bypass) is closed.  
   - D-5 (exhaust bypass) modulates to maintain zone temperature setpoint.

3. **Outside Air Damper (D-1) & Recirc Damper (D-2)**  
   - Modulate proportionally to maintain the worst-case of zone TVOC or zone temperature setpoint.

4. **Chilled Water Valve (CV-1)**  
   - Normally off.  
   - If D-1 is fully open and zone temperature is still above setpoint, CV-1 modulates to maintain zone temperature.  
   - If ZN-H > 60%:  
     1. D-5 modulates to maintain 55°F (adjustable) discharge air temperature (T-3).  
     2. D-1 and D-2 modulate proportionally to the worst-case of zone TVOC or T-3 setpoint.  
     3. CV-1 modulates to maintain 55°F (adjustable) discharge temperature.

---

#### D. Heating

1. **ERW**  
   - Enabled.

2. **Bypass Dampers**  
   - D-4 and D-5 are closed.

3. **Outside Air Damper (D-1) & Recirc Damper (D-2)**  
   - Modulate proportionally to maintain the worst-case of zone TVOC or zone temperature setpoint.

4. **Hot Water Valve (HV-1)**  
   - Normally off.  
   - If D-1 is at minimum and zone temperature is below setpoint, HV-1 modulates to maintain zone temperature.

---

### 7. Unoccupied Mode

1. **Fans Off**  
   - Supply and exhaust fans are off; dampers D-1 and D-3 are closed.

2. **ERW**  
   - Off.

3. **Chilled Water Valve**  
   - Closed.

4. **Hot Water Valve**  
   - Closed.

---

### 8. Safeties

1. **Freeze Protection**  
   - A freezestat switch is installed downstream of the heating coil.  
   - If any downstream sensor of the HW coil detects 38°F (adjustable) or lower, the supply and exhaust fans shut off via hardwired safety, and dampers D-1 and D-3 fully close.  
   - An audio/visual alarm activates.  
   - The freezestat switch must be manually reset after the issue is corrected. Then normal operation resumes.

2. **Loss of Power**  
   - If power is lost, chilled and hot water control valves fail open.

3. **Smoke Shutdown**  
   - A smoke detector in both supply and return air ducts shuts off supply and exhaust fans via hardwired safety when smoke is detected, and triggers an audio/visual alarm.  
   - After correction, the system resets and returns to normal operation.  
   - Coordinate with the fire alarm system.

4. **Frost Protection for Heat Wheel**  
   - The heat recovery low limit setpoint (HRLL-SP) is per the manufacturer.  
   - If T-6 (exhaust air) drops below HRLL-SP, bypass damper D-5 opens to protect the wheel from freezing.

5. **Emergency HVAC/Ventilation Power-Off (EPO)**  
   - If activated, DOAS-1 is disabled, and dampers D-1 and D-3 are confirmed closed. (Per instructions referencing DOAS-1)

6. **Max Ventilation Override**  
   - Activating a pushbutton switch sets OA and EA CFM to maximum for 20 minutes (adjustable).  
   - Outside air damper D-1 fully opens, and recirculation damper D-2 fully closes.  
   - Each DOAS has a switch; activating any of the five (5) switches for DOAS-1 or DOAS-2A through D initiates this sequence for all units.

7. **HW Valve Cabinet Temperature**  
   - HV-1 modulates to maintain a cabinet temperature of 55°F (T-3) when the DOAS is off.
