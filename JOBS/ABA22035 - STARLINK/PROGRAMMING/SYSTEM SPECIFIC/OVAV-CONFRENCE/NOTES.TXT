OUTSIDE AIR VOLUME (OVAV) TERMINAL UNITS (INTERIOR ROOMS WITH NO REHEAT COIL)
GENERAL:



THE TERMINAL UNIT SHALL HAVE A PRESSURE INDEPENDENT CONTROL SYSTEM. EACH SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE UNDER A DEDICATED DDC CONTROLLER.


THE SPACE THERMOSTAT FOR EACH ZONE SHALL HAVE +/- 2Â°F SETPOINT ADJUSTMENT WITH OCCUPANCY OVERRIDE.
 - If un OCCUPIED then override will set back into OCCUPIED

AIRFLOW SHALL BE MONITORED BY THE BAS. AN AIR FLOW SENSOR SHALL BE LOCATED ON THE INLET SIDE OF THE OVAV BOX.

ALL AREAS ARE INTERIOR AND NO LOADS FOR REQUIRING ACTIVE HEATING.


UNOCCUPIED MODE (AS INDICATED BY THE OCCUPANCY SENSOR):

THE OVAV DAMPER SHALL BE AT CLOSED AND THE SPACE TEMPERATURE IS ALLOWED TO DRIFT TO 2F ABOVE THE SETPOINT.

CALL FOR COOLING: THE OVAV DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT.




OCCUPIED MODE:
WHEN THE ZONE STATE IS IN THE DEAD-BAND AND THE OCCUPANCY SENSOR INDICATES THE ROOM IS OCCUPIED THE OVAV SHALL BE AT MINIMUM AIRFLOW FOR THE OCCUPIED SPACE.

GENERATOR AND HOW DO WE KNOW WHEN WE LOSE POWER. 

THE CHILLED WATER SYSTEM CONTROLLER, CHILLER CONTROLLERS, AND ONE (1) CHILLED WATER PUMP WILL BE ON EMERGENCY POWER TO MAINTAIN CHILLED WATER
CIRCULATION, PREVENTING FREEZING OF DOAS AND MUA COILS. LOSS OF POWER INDICATED BY ATS DRY CONTACT. THE BAS SHALL COMMAND ON THE CHILLED WATER PUMP
ON EMERGENCY POWER (IF NOT ALREADY ON) TO CIRCULATE WATER.

CHILLED WATER LOAD LIMIT SEQUENCE :
TO PREVENT UNNECESARY LOAD ON THE EMERGENCY GENERATOR, THE FOLLOWING SHALL OCCUR:
THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR CHILLER CAPACITY (KW) VIA HARDWIRED CONNECTION.
ONE CHILLER SHALL BE ENGAGED TO PROVIDE COOLING TO DATA CENTER, LIMITED TO 50% CHILLER CAPACITY.
DOAS VALVES WILL FAIL OPEN AND ARU VALVES CLOSED. THE ONLY REMAINING LOAD IN THE BUILDING WILL BE THE DATA CENTER.
UPON RETURN TO NORMAL POWER, THE SYSTEM SHALL AUTOMATICALLY RESET AND RESUME NORMAL OPERATION.


WHAt all has emergency Power.

How do we know when we lose power.

HOw do I only allow CHW FLow to the data center. 



A CHILLER SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO START UNLESS THE FOLLOWING HAS OCCURRED:
PROOF THAT CHILLER ISOLATION VALVE HAS OPENED

ALL SAFETY CONTROLS (CHILLED WATER FLOW SWITCH, COMPRESSOR LOW PRESSURE FLOW SWITCH, AND COMPRESSOR HIGH PRESSURE CONTROL SWITCH) ARE
