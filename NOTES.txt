DEVICE CHECKS

IF DEVICE FAIL, DEVICE DOWN, PASS THEN DEVICE IS AVAIL FOR SEQ.

ONCE SEQ HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE FOLLOWING CHECKS ARE MADE
    - DEVICE FLOW SWITCH
    - DEVICE LOW PRESS
    - DEVICE HIGH PRESS

DOAS 2 

No ERW SS and no way to control ERW SPEED as sequence requires

DOAS 1 and 2 EXA and SA Fans

COORDINATE TIMING WITH THE DAMPER ACTUATOR STROKE TIME.
EXHAUST FAN OPERATION SHALL BE PROVEN VIA CURRENT SENSOR ON EACH FAN. - Dont have any of these 

F. DOAS-2 EXHAUST FAN SHALL CFM TRACK THE SUPPLY FAN TO MAINTAIN POSITIVE PRESSURE IN THE FACTORY SPACE.
a. THE TRACKING OFFSET SHALL BE FIELD DETERMINED. ALL DOORS SHALL BE CLOSED THEN EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE ADJUSTED UNTIL THE
FACTORY IS NEUTRAL TO SLIGHTLY POSITIVE WITH PROPER OPERATION OF DOOR CLOSURES.
b. THE BUILDING AUTOMATION SYSTEM SHALL MONITOR QUANTITY OF EXHAUST FANS OPERATING IN THE FACTORY SPACE. AS FANS ARE ENERGIZED, THE
EXHAUST FAN OFFSET SHALL BE INCREMENTALLY DECREASED DOWN TO MINIMUM FAN SPEED. REFER TO FUTURE BID PACKAGES FOR QTY AND SIZE
OF EXHAUST FANS.

# Let des know about any 


Based on the provided sequence for the Air Handler Unit (AHU 1A-1L and 2A-2D) here is a list of some things that come to mind. 

Mode Determination:
The sequence does describe how to operate in cooling, heating, and dehumidification modes when the AHU is in "Occupied Mode." However, there is no clear description of how the system determines which mode (cooling, heating, dehumidification) to be in. Typically, a sequence would include conditions such as "if the zone temperature is above setpoint and the humidity is below setpoint, enter cooling mode."
 */ TEST AND BALANCE 

Supply Fan Control:
The sequence mentions that the AHU should be enabled in both cooling and heating modes, but there's no specific directive on when and how to start the supply fans or how to control their speed. This is a significant oversight as the operation of supply fans is crucial for the AHU's functioning.

Supply Fan Variable Flow:
It’s mentioned that the AHU has "TWO (2) VARIABLE FLOW DRAW-THRU SUPPLY FANS," but there's no sequence that explains how to vary the flow or under what conditions to adjust the fan speed.
 
 */ TEST AND BALANCE 

Unoccupied Mode:
The sequence describes the "Occupied Mode," but there's no mention of what should happen in "Unoccupied Mode." Typically, an AHU would have different operations for when the space is not occupied to save energy.

*/ SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN

Reset Strategies:
Often, AHU sequences will include reset strategies for supply air temperature or static pressure based on conditions like zone demands. These are missing here.
*/

Filter Status:
While the AHU has MERV 8 and MERV 14 filters, there's no mention of how to monitor filter status or any alarms related to filter status.

*/ TEST AND BALANCE will give SP

Start-Up and Shutdown Sequences:
It would be beneficial to have a clear startup and shutdown sequence for the AHU to ensure equipment longevity and avoid unnecessary wear and tear.
*/

Fans off befoer dampers closed, and FAns on before HW valve open

*/ TEST AND BALANCE

Setpoints:
There is mention of setpoints (like 55°F for chilled water coil leaving temperature), but it's not clear if these are fixed or if they can be adjusted through the Building Automation System (BAS).

Differential Pressures:
It would be helpful to include sequences or alarms related to differential pressures across coils or filters to ensure they are operating efficiently and aren't clogged or restricted.

While the sequence provides a foundational framework for the AHU's operation, it lacks specifics in several key areas that are crucial for an efficient and effective operation.

I can program exactly what the sequences ask for but  AS the sequences for the ARU's 1A-1L and 2A-2D are a copy and paste  as they are written  it's simply only half way done. If I am to come up with my own sequences and controls for these points as they would be considered standard practice it will add significantly more time to their programming for the development and implementation which I assume have not been billed out or accounted for.

SAFETIES:
A. FREEZE PROTECTION: A FREEZESTAT SWITCH SHALL BE INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM OF THE HEATING COIL. IF A TEMPERATURE OF 38 °F (ADJ.) OR LESS IS DETECTED, THE
FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. DAMPERS, D-1 AND D-3 SHALL FULLY CLOSE, AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM SHALL ACTIVATE. THE FREEZESTAT SWITCH
MUST BE MANUALLY RESET UPON CORRECTION OF THE PROBLEM. UPON A MANUAL RESET, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.

B. LOSS OF POWER: UPON A LOSS OF POWER, THE CONTROL VALVES SERVING CHILLED AND HOT WATER COILS SHALL FAIL OPEN.

C. OVER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL: A HIGH STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE SUPPLY AIR OUTLET, BEFORE ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE
DAMPERS. IF THE PRESSURE IN THE OA DUCT EXCEEDS 3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. UPON A MANUAL RESET OF
THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.
D. UNDER PRESSURIZATION CONTROL: A LOW STATIC PRESSURE SWITCH SHALL BE LOCATED AT THE EXHAUST AIR INLET, AFTER ANY FIRE DAMPERS OR SMOKE
DAMPERS. IF THE PRESSURE IN THE EA DUCT EXCEEDS -3.0" W.G. LOCALLY (ADJ.), THEN ALL FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY. UPON A MANUAL RESET OF
THE SWITCH, THE SYSTEM SHALL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.
E. SMOKE SHUTDOWN: A SMOKE DETECTOR SHALL BE LOCATED IN THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR DUCTS. IF SMOKE IS DETECTED, THE SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS SHALL
SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM WILL ACTIVATE. UPON CORRECTION, THE SYSTEM SHALL BE RESET AND RETURN TO NORMAL
OPERATION. COORDINATE WITH FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.
F. FROST PROTECTION SEQUENCE FOR THE HEAT WHEEL: THE HEAT RECOVERY LOW LIMIT SETPOINT (HRLL-SP) SHALL BE PER THE MANUFACTURERS TEMPERATURE
SETPOINT. TO PREVENT FREEZING, IF T-6 (EA) DROPS BELOW THE HRLL-SP, THE BYPASS DAMPER D-3 SHALL OPEN TO BYPASS WHEEL.
G. EMERGENCY HVAC/VENTILATION POWER-OFF BUTTON (EPO): IF THE EMERGENCY POWER SHUTDOWN IS ACTIVATED THEN DOAS-1 SHALL BE DISABLED AND D-1 AND D-3
CONFIRMED TO BE CLOSED.
H. THE HOT WATER VALVE, HV-1, SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN A CABINET TEMPERATURE, AT T-3, OF 55°F WHEN THE DOAS IS OFF.
I. MAX VENTILATION OVERRIDE: UPON ACTIVATION OF A PUSHBUTTON SWITCH, THE DOAS SHALL INCREASE OA CFM TO MAXIMUM SETPOINT FOR 20 MINUTES (ADJ.). EACH
DOAS SHALL BE PROVIDED WITH A SWITCH. ACTIVATING ANY OF THE (3) SWITCHES ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER DOAS-2A, 2B, OR 2C SHALL ACTIVATE THIS SEQUENCE FOR
DOAS-2, 2B, AND 2C. ACTIVATING THE SWITCH ASSOCIATED WITH DOAS-2D SHALL ONLY ACTIVATE THIS SEQUENCE FOR DOAS-2D.
