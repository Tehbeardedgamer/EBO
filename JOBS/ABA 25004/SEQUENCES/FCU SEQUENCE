## COOLING ONLY FAN COIL UNITS CONTROLS SEQUENCE

---

### 1. Overview

Each cooling-only fan coil unit (FCU) includes:
- A wall-mounted room thermostat/temperature sensor that provides input to the BAS.  
- A fully programmable unitary controller that executes the required control sequence.

### 2. General Operation

1. **2-Way Modulating Control Valve**  
   - Each FCU has a 2-way modulating control valve on the chilled water coil.  
   - The BAS provides a separate output to ensure the valve closes off water flow 2 minutes (adjustable) before the fan shuts off.

2. **Occupied/Unoccupied Fan Logic**  
   - When the zone temperature setpoint is satisfied, the fan is off, and the chilled water valve is fully closed.  
   - When the zone temperature is above setpoint, the fan energizes and modulates speed to maintain the space temperature setpoint. The chilled water valve modulates to maintain a discharge temperature setpoint of 55 °F (adjustable).

3. **Setpoint Limit Adjustment**  
   - Each fan coil’s graphics page provides user-adjustable setpoint limits ranging from 70 °F (adjustable) to 76 °F (adjustable).

4. **Condensate Overflow Switch**  
   - A condensate overflow switch is hardwired to each fan coil. If activated, the unit de-energizes, and the chilled water valve fully closes.

### 3. Alarms

#### 3.1 Level 1 Alarm

- **Condensate Overflow Switch Active**  

#### 3.2 Level 2 Alarms

1. **High Temperature Alarm**  
   - Space temperature is 10 °F above setpoint for 30 minutes (adjustable).  
2. **Condensate Pump Status Mismatch**  
   - Condensate pump status does not equal command.
