MAIN FACTORY FLOOR AIR ROTATION UNITS (ARU-1A THRU L FOR LARGE CEILING SPACE, ARU-2A THRU D FOR UNDER MEZZ SPACE)

1. THE AIR ROTATION UNITS SHALL CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING:
A. TWO (2) VARIABLE FLOW DRAW-THRU SUPPLY FANS
B. CHILLED WATER COIL
C. HOT WATER COIL
D. SCR ELECTRIC HEAT COIL
E. FACE AND BYPASS DAMPER
F. MERV 8 PREFILTER, MERV 14 FILTER

2. GENERAL AIR ROTATION UNIT:

A. THE SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE UNDER THE CONTROL OF A DEDICATED DDC CONTROLLER.
B. IF COMMUNICATION IS LOST BETWEEN THE NETWORK CONTROL PANEL AND THE AIR ROTATION UNIT CONTROLLER, THEN THE AIR ROTATION UNIT SHALL BE PLACED INTO THE OCCUPIED MODE UNTIL COMMUNICATION IS RESTORED.
C. THE ELECTRIC HEAT AND CHILLED WATER VALVE SHALL NEVER BE ON/ OPEN AT THE SAME TIME.
D. VALVES SHALL BE PRESSURE INDEPENDENT WITH FLOW FEEDBACK TO THE BAS - BELIMO ENERGY VALVE OR EQUAL.
E. CONTINUITY OF OPERATION AFTER ELECTRIC POWER INTERRUPTION
    • EQUIPMENT AND ASSOCIATED FACTORY CONTROLS, FIELD INSTALLED CONTROLS, ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT AND POWER SUPPLY CONNECTED TO BUILDING NORMAL AND BACK-UP POWER SYSTEMS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RETURN EQUIPMENT AND
    IMMEDIATELY BEFORE LOSS OF NORMAL POWER WITHOUT NEED FOR MANUAL INTERVENTION BY OPERATOR WHEN POWER IS RESTORED EITHER THROUGH BACK-UP POWER SOURCE, OR
    THROUGH NORMAL POWER IF RESTORED BEFORE BACK-UP POWER IS BROUGHT ON-LINE.

F. ARU-1/2 EQUIPMENT OVERRIDE
    • OPERATOR WILL HAVE ABILITY TO OVERRIDE EQUIPMENT LOCALLY AT EQUIPMENT MOTOR CONTROLLER. MOTOR CONTROLLER WILL HAVE HOA SWITCH, OR SIMILAR STYLE SWITCH, TO PROVIDE FOR REMOTE AUTOMATIC CONTROL, OR LOCAL COTROL

G. EQUIPMENT RUNTIME CALCULATION
    • EQUIPMENT RUNTIME CALCULATION INITIATE EQUIPMENT RUNTIME CALCULATION ON START COMMAND AND EQUIPMENT "ON" STATUS FEEDBACK. CALCULATE RUNTIME IN HOURS AND TOTALIZE HOURS FOR EACH DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, AND
    SINCE INSTALLED. INTERRUPT CALCULATION ON STOP COMMAND AND EQUIPMENT "OFF" STATUS FEEDBACK.
    • DDC CONTROLLER WILL MONITOR OPERATING HOURS AGAINST OPERATOR INPUT EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE INTERVALS (HOURS) AND SIGNAL A WARNING WHEN EQUIPMENT OPERATING HOURS ARE APPROACHING MAINTENANCE INTERVAL.

3. OCCUPIED MODE:

A. COOLING MODE:
    a. ARU SHALL BE ENABLED AND THE 2-WAY, MODULATING CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE CV-1 SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN 55°F LEAVING THE CHILLED WATER COIL T-3. THE FACE AND BYPASS DAMPER SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZONE
    TEMPERATURE SETPOINT ZN-T WHILE MAINTAINING PROPER THROW TO CONDITION THE ENTIRE SPACE, HOT WATER VALVE SHALL BE CLOSED AND THE ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER SHALL BE OFF.

   

B. HEATING MODE:
    a. ARU SHALL BE ENABLED AND THE HOT WATER VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZN-T SETPOINT WITH MAXIMUM DAT OF 80°F (ADJ). THE FACE AND BYPASS DAMPER SHALL BE CLOSE TO CHILLED WATER COIL AND FULLY OPEN TO BYPASS,
    CHILLED WATER AND PROCESS WATER VALVES SHALL BE CLOSED. IF ADDITIONAL HEATING IS REQUIRED, THEN SCR ELECTRIC HEATING SHALL BE ENGAGED AND MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZN-T SETPOINT.

C. DEHUMIDIFICATION MODE:
    a. THE 2-WAY, MODULATING CHILLED WATER CONTROL VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN 53°F LEAVING THE CHILLED WATER COIL. THE HOT WATER VALVE SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZONE TEMPERATURE SETPOINT ZN-T. THE ELECTRIC DUCT HEATER SHALL BE OFF.
    b. IF THE PROCESS WATER TEMPERATURE IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ZN-T SETPOINT (PROCESS SUPPLY WATER TOO COLD) THEN THE SCR DUCT HEATER SHALL MODULATE TO MAINTAIN ZN-T SETPOINT. IF PWS IS LESS THAN 72°F (ADJ), THE PROCESS WATER VALVE SHALL CLOSE.

4. SAFETIES:
    A. SMOKE SHUTDOWN: A SMOKE DETECTOR SHALL BE LOCATED IN THE SUPPLY AND RETURN AIR DUCTS. IF SMOKE IS DETECTED, THE SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS SHALL SHUT-OFF VIA HARDWIRED SAFETY AND AN AUDIO/VISUAL ALARM WILL ACTIVATE.
    UPON CORRECTION, THE SYSTEM SHALL BE RESET AND RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION. COORDINATE WITH FIRE ALARM SYSTEM.

    B. LOSS OF POWER: UPON A LOSS OF POWER, THE CONTROL VALVES SERVING THE CHILLED AND HOT WATER COILS SHALL FAIL CLOSED.

5. ALARMS:

A. LEVEL 1 ALARM
    a. SMOKE DETECTOR ALARM.

B. B. LEVEL 2 ALARMS:
    a. HIGH HUMIDITY ALARM: ANY SPACE HUMIDITY IS 70% OR GREATER THAN SETPOINT FOR 30 MINUTES (ADJ.).
    b. HIGH TEMPERATURE ALARM: SPACE TEMPERATURE IS 10°F ABOVE SETPOINT FOR 60 MINUTES.
    c. CONDENSATE OVERFLOW ALARM: CONDENSATE OVERFLOW SWITCH IS ACTIVATED. UNIT SHALL CONTINUE TO OPERATE REGARDLESS OF ALARM STATUS.

C. LEVEL 3 ALARMS:
    a. CONTROLLER (CGM-6) FAILURE ALARM.
    b. FAN STATUS DOES NOT EQUAL COMMAND.
    c. HIGH TEMPERATURE ALARM: SPACE TEMPERATURE) IS 5°F ABOVE SETPOINT FOR 30 MINUTES.
    d. HIGH HUMIDITY ALARM: ANY SPACE HUMIDITY IS 65% OR GREATER THAN SETPOINT FOR 15 MINUTES (ADJ.).
    e. VALVE STATUS DOES NOT EQUAL COMMAND. CV-1 OR RC-1
    f. SIMULTANEOUS HEATING/COOLING:

• IN COOLING MODE: IF T-4 IS 5°F MORE THAN T-3.
• IN HEATING MODE: IF T-2 IS 5°F LESS THAN ZN-T.

D. LEVEL 4 ALARMS:
    a. AIR ROTATION UNIT RUNTIME MAINTENANCE ALARM PER THE MANUFACTURER’S RECOMMENDATIONS.
