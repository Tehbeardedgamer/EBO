## CABINET HEATERS CONTROLS SEQUENCE

---

### 1. Overview

Each cabinet heater includes:
- A wall-mounted room thermostat/temperature sensor providing input to the BAS.  
- A fully programmable unitary controller that runs the required control sequence.

### 2. General Operation

1. **2-Way Modulating Control Valve (Hot Water Coil)**  
   - Each cabinet heater uses a 2-way modulating control valve on the hot water coil.  
   - Provide a separate output so that water flow closes off 2 minutes (adjustable) before the fan shuts off.

2. **Occupied/Unoccupied Heating Logic**  
   - When the zone temperature setpoint is met, the fan is off, and the hot water control valve is fully closed.  
   - When the zone temperature is below setpoint, the fan energizes at minimum speed, and the hot water valve modulates to maintain setpoint.  
   - **Fan speed override**: If the hot water valve reaches 100% for 15 minutes (adjustable) and cannot maintain setpoint, the fan is released to modulate speed until the zone temperature is reached.

3. **Setpoint Limit Adjustment**  
   - Each cabinet heater has a graphics page with user-adjustable setpoint limits between 68 °F (adjustable) and 72 °F (adjustable).
