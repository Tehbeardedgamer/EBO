OUTSIDE AIR VOLUME (OVAV) TERMINAL UNITS (OVAV WITH DCV- DEMAND CONTROL VENTILATION)

GENERAL:
THE TERMINAL UNIT SHALL HAVE A PRESSURE INDEPENDENT CONTROL SYSTEM. EACH SYSTEM SHALL OPERATE UNDER A DEDICATED
DDC CONTROLLER.

A WALL MOUNTED CARBON DIOXIDE SENSOR AND OCCUPANCY SENSOR SHALL CONTROL THE OVAV.

THE CARBON DIOXIDE SENSOR FOR EACH ZONE SHALL HAVE 1000 PPM SETPOINT.

AIRFLOW SHALL BE MONITORED BY THE BAS. AN AIR FLOW SENSOR SHALL BE LOCATED ON THE INLET SIDE OF THE OVAV BOX.
THE OVAV PROVIDES VENTILATION AND 1 ST STAGE OF COOLING. ALL AREAS ARE SERVED BY A DEDICATED HEAT PUMP FOR CONDITIONING.


UNOCCUPIED MODE (AS INDICATED BY THE OCCUPANCY SENSOR):

THE OVAV DAMPER SHALL BE AT CLOSED AFTER THE CO2 LEVELS OF 550 PPM IS ACHIEVED.
ZONE 2-03 THERE ARE (2) CO2 SENSORS FOR THIS ZONE. THE OAV BOX SHALL SIGNAL SELECT BASED ON THE WORST CASE READING. THERE IS ALSO
AN INDEPENDANT TEMPERATURE SENSOR (APART FROM THE VHP SERVING THIS SPACE) THAT SHALL OPEN/CLOSE A DAMPER FOR THE IT
WORKSHOP.

OCCUPIED MODE:

OVAV SHALL MAINTAIN A CO2 SETPOINT OF 1000 PPM.

DUCT STATIC PRESSURE RESET REQUESTS:
THE DDC SYSTEM SHALL DETERMINE THE OVAV WITH GREATEST DAMPER OPEN POSITION ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES.
THE DOAS OUTSIDE AIR STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL DECREASE BY 0.1" WC IF ALL OVAVS ARE OPEN 75% (ADJ.) OR LESS.
THE DOAS OUTSIDE AIR STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL INCREASE BY 0.1" WC IF THE GREATEST OPEN DAMPER POSITION FOR AN
OVAV IS 95% (ADJ.) OR GREATER.

SETPOINT SHALL BE RESET BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM SETPOINT OF 0.5" WC AND 1.50 ‚Äù WC.

THE DOAS GRAPHICS WILL INDICATE THE OVAV WITH THE GREATEST OPEN POSITION FOR TROUBLE SHOOTING.
